Greg::   ...
<i>He hears muffled voices and hazily opens his eyes, </i>
<i>only to shut them again when hit with a glaring light.</i>
Margaret::   Greg?
<i>Greg turns his head as fast as he can, </i>
<i>ignoring the pain in his neck from being in a period of stasis for a long time.</i>
Greg::   Maggie, I'm so sorry, I-
Margaret::   No. Please don't apologize. I'm just glad you're awake.
Margaret::   ...I- I thought you weren't going to wake up. 
<i>He reaches for her cheek in an attempt to wipe her tears, </i>
<i>but only manages to hold onto her hand.</i> 
<i>Margaret squeezes it, in a way to reassure herself that this wasn't a dream.</i>
Greg::   I'm back now so don't cry.
Margaret::  Yeah, welcome back tiger.
